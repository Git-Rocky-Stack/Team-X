/**
 * Command palette IPC contracts (Phase 5 — M30 T5).
 *
 * These types mirror the structural shapes exposed by `CommandService`
 * in `apps/desktop/src/main/services/command-service.ts`. The desktop
 * service is the source of truth for the runtime behaviour; this file
 * is the source of truth for the `command.*` IPC channel payloads so
 * the renderer and the preload can type-check against a single
 * workspace-root contract without pulling a desktop-side dependency
 * into `@team-x/shared-types`.
 *
 * Why duplicate the shapes here instead of re-exporting from
 * `@team-x/intelligence` or `apps/desktop`:
 *
 *   - `@team-x/shared-types` is a leaf package with no workspace deps
 *     other than zod at runtime and TypeScript at build time. Pulling
 *     in `@team-x/intelligence` would add a dep edge from a leaf onto
 *     a package that already imports shared-types (`DashboardEvent`,
 *     etc.), closing a cycle.
 *   - The renderer must not see `apps/desktop` types — it communicates
 *     with main exclusively through `@team-x/shared-types`.
 *   - A parallel, hand-mirrored shape pinned by a compile-time
 *     `Expect<Equal<...>>` check in the desktop package guarantees the
 *     two never drift silently.
 *
 * The `IpcIntentName` union MUST stay in lock-step with
 * `IntentName` in `@team-x/intelligence`. The desktop package's
 * `command-handlers.ts` enforces this with a type-level equality
 * check: if `INTENT_NAMES` in intelligence grows a value,
 * `tsc --build` in the desktop app fails until this union is updated.
 */

/**
 * The canonical set of intent names the NLU engine can classify.
 *
 * Copy of `INTENT_NAMES` in `@team-x/intelligence/nlu/intent-classifier`.
 * Update both in the same commit — the type-equality check in
 * `apps/desktop/src/main/ipc/command-handlers.ts` makes drift a build
 * failure.
