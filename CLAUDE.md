# CLAUDE.md

> ### 🚧 PHASE 5.6 IN PROGRESS — M-D UI BACKFILL SHIPPED, M-F HEAD-OF-QUEUE (2026-04-19)
>
> A pre-M36-T2 audit surfaced systemic drift between CLAUDE.md status blocks and on-disk reality across Phases 1–5. **Phase 5.6 is a Definition-of-Done failure repair operation, not a "fix some missing files" sprint.** Execution order is M-A (audit) → M-B (triage) → **M-E (process safeguards — ships BEFORE backfill)** → M-C (backend backfill) → M-D (UI backfill) → M-F (docs truth-up) → M-G (ship). Estimated 6–8 calendar weeks.
>
> **M-A Conformance Audit SHIPPED 2026-04-17** — `docs/audits/2026-04-17-conformance-audit.md` (414 rows). Status distribution: 350 shipped / 19 partial / 16 missing / 8 unverifiable. Severity rollup (non-shipped): **15 P0** / 8 P1 / 10 P2 / 16 P3. Two P0 clusters, both stranded on `worktree-phase-2-the-org`:
> - **Cluster A — Multi-company architecture (M7, Rocky's LOCKED design — not aspirational):** `companies.create/update/delete` IPC + `WorkspaceSwitcher` + `CreateCompanyDialog` + `CompanySettings` panel. **7 P0 rows → RESTORE.**
> - **Cluster B — M9 org chart:** `orgchart.get` IPC + `employees.promote` + `employees.setManager` + `org_edges` table + tree UI + drag-to-rearrange. **8 P0 rows → RESTORE.**
>
> **M-C Backend Backfill SHIPPED 2026-04-18** — restored the Cluster A/B backend surface: `companies.create/update/delete`, `orgchart.get`, `employees.promote`, `employees.setManager`, `org_edges`, and invariant #11 bus events. Evidence: `docs/plans/2026-04-17-team-x-phase-5.6-remediation.md`, `.loki/queue/current-task.json`, and `pnpm audit:claims` 92 verified / 3 allowlisted / 0 UNALLOWED.
>
> **M-D UI Backfill SHIPPED 2026-04-19** — restored WorkspaceSwitcher, CreateCompanyDialog, CompanySettings, HireDialog manager-select, Chat tab, OrgChartView, drag reassignment, promote/fire, and company/employee lifecycle E2E audit assertions. Evidence: `docs/plans/2026-04-19-team-x-phase-5.6-m-d-ui-backfill.md`, `docs/qa/2026-04-19-m-d-step-g-verification-gate.md`, full Vitest 125 files / 1683 tests, full Playwright 13 specs / 18 cases, typecheck clean, lint 0 errors / 21 warnings, and `pnpm audit:claims` 92 / 3 / 0.
>
> The CLAUDE.md Troubleshooting section currently frames Cluster A as "aspirational for the milestone that introduces multi-company CRUD" — **that paragraph is itself part of the drift and will be rewritten in M-F** (see audit §18.5). Multi-company CRUD is a **core Phase 2 M7 architectural decision**, not a down-stream deferral.
>
> **Phase 6 M36 T2+ is explicitly PAUSED** until Phase 5.6 M-G ships. Do not resume capability taxonomy work until the pause is lifted in `.loki/queue/pending.json`.
>
> **Read before acting:**
> - Active plan: [`docs/plans/2026-04-17-team-x-phase-5.6-remediation.md`](docs/plans/2026-04-17-team-x-phase-5.6-remediation.md)
> - **M-A conformance audit:** [`docs/audits/2026-04-17-conformance-audit.md`](docs/audits/2026-04-17-conformance-audit.md) — required reading before M-B
> - Immediate next task: Phase 5.6 M-F Documentation Truth-Up (see `.loki/queue/current-task.json`) — rewrite CLAUDE.md status blocks in the three-bucket format (shipped / deferred / deprecated), remove the Cluster A "aspirational" framing, align IPC channel names with on-disk reality, and preserve the M-D exit KPI evidence.
> - Sprint framework: §14 of the plan (DoR, DoD, velocity KPI, change-control mini-gate — invoked once in M-A per scope-expansion record)
>
> Status blocks below reflect state as of Phase 5 exit (v1.1.0, 2026-04-20). M-A audit matrix supersedes them for claim-vs-reality questions; M-F will rewrite them in a three-bucket format (shipped / deferred / deprecated). **Treat unaudited status-block claims as `🔍 unverified` — use the M-A audit doc as the truth source until M-F rewrites ship.**

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What Team-X is

Team-X is an open-source, privacy-first, **local-first desktop app for running AI-agent organizations**. You don't manage prompts or pipelines — you run a **company**: hire employees from a curated F10 role library, assemble an org chart with real hierarchy (Officer → Senior Management → Management → Supervisor → Lead → IC), set company goals, break them into projects, file tickets, watch the team work in real-time on a multi-view cockpit, chat with anyone on demand, and pull everyone into an all-hands meeting with one click. Runs on local models (Ollama / Qwen / Gemma) by default; plug Claude, OpenAI/Codex, Google, OpenRouter, Groq, Together, Fireworks, or any OpenAI-compatible provider when you want cloud power.

**Tagline candidate:** *"Run an AI company. Not a prompt."*

## Source of truth

**Before proposing any architectural change, read the design document:**

- [`docs/plans/2026-04-07-team-x-design.md`](docs/plans/2026-04-07-team-x-design.md) — full approved design (v1.0, 2026-04-07)

The decisions log in §15 of that doc is **locked** unless explicitly revisited with the user. If you find yourself disagreeing with a decision, raise it as a discussion — don't silently deviate.

## Status

### Phase 1 (Skeleton) — complete

**Phase 2 (The Org) — complete.** All 13 milestones shipped.

**Phase 3 (The Live Cockpit) — complete.** All 20 milestones shipped.

**Phase 4 (Ship-readiness) — complete.** All 27 milestones shipped. v1.0.0. 612 unit tests + 4 E2E specs passing.

**Phase 5 (Intelligence Layer) — complete. All 8 milestones shipped (M28 → M35). v1.1.0.**

## Phase plan (locked)

1. **Phase 1 — Skeleton** — Electron boot, SQLite, 1 hardcoded company, CEO + 1 SWE, AI SDK + Anthropic + Ollama, bare Cards dashboard with live token stream. Demo: *"Hire a CEO, chat with it, watch it think."*
2. **Phase 2 — The Org** — Role pack loader + 55 roles, multi-company, org chart editor, MCP host, tickets + kanban. Demo: *"File a ticket → agent picks it up, uses an MCP, closes it."*
3. **Phase 3 — The Live Cockpit** — All 5 dashboard subviews, meeting primitive, goals + projects, telemetry, runtime modes, privacy tier filter. Demo: *"One-click all-hands → minutes → action items → tickets."*
4. **Phase 4 — Ship-readiness** — File vault, backup/restore, audit log UI, installers, landing site, public release.
5. **Phase 5 — Intelligence Layer** — `packages/intelligence` (RAG + NLU + agentic loop), command palette, system-agent pseudo-employee, write-side task planner, in-app copilot. Demo: *"Ask `Cmd+K` — 'why is the frontend team behind?' — get a grounded multi-paragraph answer citing specific tickets, employees, and events."*

## Build commands

**Install and run:**

```bash
pnpm install                    # install workspace deps (runs electron-rebuild postinstall)
pnpm dev                        # electron-vite dev server (main + renderer HMR)
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop dev     # same, scoped to the desktop app
pnpm build                      # production build of all workspaces
```

**Packaged installers (Phase 4 — M25):**

```bash
pnpm dist                       # build + package for current platform
pnpm dist:win                   # Windows NSIS installer (x64 + arm64)
pnpm dist:mac                   # macOS DMG (x64 + arm64)
pnpm dist:linux                 # Linux AppImage + deb (x64)
pnpm dist:publish               # build + upload to GitHub Release draft
```

Output lands in `release/<version>/`. Playwright E2E tests are wired (T49) and run via `pnpm -F @team-x/desktop test:e2e`.

**Test, typecheck, lint:**

```bash
pnpm test                       # vitest run across all workspaces (602 tests)
pnpm test:watch                 # vitest in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage              # vitest with coverage report
pnpm typecheck                  # tsc --noEmit across all workspaces
pnpm lint                       # biome check
pnpm lint:fix                   # biome check --write
pnpm format                     # biome format --write
```

**End-to-end smoke test (Playwright + real Electron):**

```bash
# Full build + run — what CI does and what you should run before /ship.
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop test:e2e

# Skip the build (faster iteration when out/main is already current).
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop test:e2e:run
```

Three E2E specs live under `apps/desktop/e2e/`:

- `smoke.spec.ts` — Phase 1 chat round-trip (boot, render employees, send message, canned reply).
- `ticket-flow.spec.ts` — Phase 2 ticket lifecycle (navigate to Tickets, create ticket with assignee, agent processes via test-mode provider, verify reply in detail panel).
- `meeting-flow.spec.ts` — Phase 3 meeting lifecycle (navigate to Meetings, call meeting with attendees, Rocky interjects, end meeting, verify minutes generation).

All three launch a real Electron instance against `out/main/index.js` with
`NODE_ENV=test`, which flips `provider-factory.isTestMode()` to `true`
and swaps the resolver for the canned-reply `createTestModeResolveProvider`.
No Ollama, no Anthropic key, no network — the full round-trips are
exercised through the orchestrator and event bus end-to-end.

Each run gets its own throwaway `--user-data-dir=<tmp>` so the test
SQLite database never collides with Rocky's real dev DB at
`%APPDATA%/Team-X/team-x/team-x.sqlite`.

**Manual smoke against a real local LLM (Ollama):**

```bash
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop exec tsx scripts/smoke-chat.ts
```

Requires `ollama serve` running locally with `llama3.1:8b` (or whatever
you set as `modelPref`) pulled. Streams a real response to stdout —
the fastest way to verify the orchestrator + provider router pipeline
end-to-end without booting Electron.

**Typecheck caveat — important.** Always run `pnpm typecheck` at the repo root (which expands to `pnpm -r typecheck`). The workspace-scoped `pnpm -F @team-x/desktop typecheck` does NOT traverse project references and silently misses per-package composite-mode regressions in the shared workspace packages. This cost real debugging time in Task 18 — do not shortcut it.

**Database migrations (Drizzle):**

```bash
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop exec drizzle-kit generate --name <snake_case_name>
```

Emits a new migration to `apps/desktop/src/main/db/migrations/`. Commit the resulting `.sql` file along with the updated `meta/_journal.json` and `meta/*_snapshot.json` that drizzle-kit writes alongside it.

**Native module rebuilds:**

```bash
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3,keytar
```

Rebuilds both native modules against Electron's ABI. **Use the comma-separated form** for multi-module rebuilds — `@electron/rebuild@3.7.2`'s CLI crashes with `argv.w.split is not a function` on repeated `-w` flags (it calls `.split(',')` on the value internally). When adding a new native module, extend the comma list, not a second `-w` flag. The `@team-x/desktop` postinstall script already uses this form; mirror it if you script a rebuild elsewhere.

## Architectural invariants

These are non-negotiable. Violating any of them requires a design-doc amendment.

1. **Renderer is a pure view.** No direct LLM or MCP calls. Every interaction crosses the typed IPC bridge into Main. Context isolation on. No node integration in renderer.
2. **Orchestrator is the only scheduler.** If the orchestrator says pause (e.g., during a meeting), nothing new dispatches. This keeps the meeting primitive race-free.
3. **MCP Host is a singleton in Main.** One pool of MCP connections; agents request tool calls via message passing. Never spawn N MCP clients from N workers.
4. **Storage is SQLite + filesystem vault.** Metadata in SQLite, blobs on disk, SHA256 integrity. **Never** store file blobs in SQLite — that breaks the zero-file-size-limit guarantee.
5. **Provider router is the only place that touches LLM APIs.** It enforces privacy tiers, concurrency caps, and cost tracking.
6. **Events table is append-only.** Source of truth for the realtime dashboard. Orchestrator writes; renderer subscribes.
7. **Zero phone-home.** Ever. No anonymized metrics. Updates are explicitly user-triggered. This is the privacy-first posture and it does not get traded away.
8. **Secrets live in the OS keychain** (keytar). Never plaintext in config files.
9. **Role-pack user edits are saved as overrides**, not mutations of the pack. Upstream pack updates must never clobber user customizations.
10. **Runtime strategy is adaptive.** Default Auto; profile hardware + providers on startup; pick Hybrid / Always-On / Lean. User override always wins.
11. **IPC channels that mutate state must emit a bus event.** Renderer-side caches subscribe to the bus for invalidation; IPC alone is not enough because E2E specs and programmatic callers bypass React Query. This was the root cause of the vault-backup.spec.ts regression (findings: `docs/plans/2026-04-13-vault-backup-regression-findings.md` §7).

## Working with role packs

The curated F10 role library is the crown jewel. When creating or editing `role.md` files in `role-packs/strategia-official/`:

- **Match the quality bar** of `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and Rocky's Strategia-X writing voice: executive, authoritative, direct, F10. No marketing fluff.
- **Always include** the full frontmatter: `id`, `name`, `level`, `reports_to`, `manages`, `preferred_model_tier`, `preferred_providers`, `fallback_providers`, `tools_allowed`, `tools_denied`, `decision_authority`, `kpis`, `output_format`, `temperature`, `license`, `author`, `version`.
- **Use template variables** (`{{company.name}}`, `{{company.mission}}`, `{{employee.name}}`, etc.) so one role.md serves many companies.
- **Structure the body** with: `# Identity`, `# Mission`, `# Responsibilities`, `# Decision Framework`, `# Communication Style`, `# Escalation Rules`, `# Output Format`.
- **Version bumps** follow semver. Breaking changes to frontmatter keys are major bumps.

## Working with providers & models

- **Never hardcode model names** in code. Models live in the `model_registry` table, populated from a versioned JSON manifest that ships with role packs and can be updated independently.
- **Respect privacy tiers.** Every provider has `privacy_tier ∈ { local, open-source-cloud, proprietary-cloud }`. The provider router enforces the user's privacy filter at call time. If a role requests a provider the filter blocks, fall back per `fallback_providers`.
- **Respect per-provider concurrency caps** defined in settings. Defaults: ollama=1, anthropic=4, openai=6, openrouter=8, groq=10, together=6, fireworks=6, google=4.
- **Track every call** in the `runs` table with provider, model, tokens, latency, cost. Cost telemetry is user-visible in the Telemetry tab.

## Security posture (public-release grade from day one)

- Context isolation + disabled node integration in renderer.
- All IPC typed via preload bridge; no `ipcRenderer` exposed.
- API keys in OS keychain.
- MCP `tools_denied` enforced at the host, not in the agent prompt.
- Community role packs require signature verification (phase 4+).
- Append-only audit log in `events` table for every sensitive action (hire, fire, MCP add, backup restore).

## Testing expectations

- **Unit tests (Vitest)** for: role.md parser, provider router logic, orchestrator scheduler math, telemetry calculations, backup/restore round-trip.
- **Integration tests (Vitest)** for: MCP host + one real MCP, Drizzle migrations, worker lifecycle, meeting pause/resume.
- **E2E tests (Playwright)** for: hire flow, chat flow, ticket assign → close flow, meeting flow, backup/restore flow, RAG flow, command palette flow. Seven specs ship today: smoke, ticket-flow, meeting-flow, vault-backup, rag-flow, command-palette, plus the Phase 4 baseline. All run against the canned test-mode provider (and canned classifier for command-palette).
- Every Phase-X demo must have green tests before the phase is marked shippable.

## IPC channels (Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 5)

| | `command.getRunSnapshot` | Backfill projection (`runId, threadId, steps[]`) for `useAgentStepStream` on mount — closes M31 F1 (M32 T0) |

**Bus events added in Phase 5 (not IPC — append-only on the `events` table, consumed by the renderer via the event bus):**

| Event | Emitted by | Milestone | Payload shape |

## Troubleshooting

**`Cannot find module '...better_sqlite3.node'` or any native-module ABI mismatch.** Electron rebuilds against its own Node ABI; pnpm installs against the system Node. Run the rebuild after every dep change that touches native modules:

```bash
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3,keytar
```

The `@team-x/desktop` postinstall script does this automatically on `pnpm install`. If you're seeing the error after a dep upgrade, it usually means the postinstall hook was skipped — re-run install with `--force`.

**Ollama smoke chat fails with `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:11434`.** Ollama isn't running. Start it (`ollama serve` on Linux/macOS, or open the Ollama desktop app on Windows) and re-run. Confirm the model is pulled:

```bash
ollama list
ollama pull llama3.1:8b   # or whatever the test references
```

If Ollama is bound to a non-default host, set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` in `apps/desktop/.env` — see `bootstrapEnvKeys` for the full env-key import contract.

**Drizzle migrations are out of sync — "table already exists" or "missing column" on dev boot.** The dev DB lives at `%APPDATA%/Team-X/team-x/team-x.sqlite` on Windows. Nuke it and let the next boot reseed:

```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Force "$env:APPDATA\Team-X\team-x\team-x.sqlite*"

# macOS / Linux equivalent
rm -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Team-X/team-x/team-x.sqlite*
```

The `*` glob also removes the `-shm` and `-wal` WAL companion files. On the next `pnpm dev`, migrations re-run from scratch and `seedIfEmpty()` reseeds the Strategia-X company + CEO + SWE.

**Playwright E2E hangs at the 90s test timeout.** The smoke test is supposed to finish in ~1-2 seconds. A hang means one of the assertions is waiting on an element that never appears. Things to check, in order:

1. The renderer crashed silently — read the `[renderer pageerror]` and `[renderer error]` lines forwarded by `e2e/smoke.spec.ts`.
2. A locator regex doesn't match the entire accessible name — Playwright's `getByRole({ name: regex })` is anchored, so use attribute-starts-with selectors (`button[aria-label^="..."]`) for robust matches.
3. `app.close()` itself is hanging — the will-quit handler in `main/index.ts` calls `app.exit(0)` after the orchestrator drains; if that ever stops working, the afterEach will force-kill after 5s and the test will surface the real assertion that failed before the hang.

**`pnpm typecheck` passes but unit tests fail with "test is not defined".** Vitest is picking up an `e2e/*.spec.ts` Playwright file. Confirm `apps/desktop/vitest.config.ts` excludes `e2e/**` — the per-workspace exclude is required because `vitest.workspace.ts` resolves projects independently and the root `vitest.config.ts` exclude does not propagate down.

**DevTools auto-opens during the Playwright run and the test hangs.** Should not happen — `main/index.ts` gates `openDevTools` on `process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'test'`. If the gate ever regresses, DevTools and Playwright fight over the same Chrome DevTools Protocol channel and every `expect().toBeVisible()` hangs indefinitely.

**Production build fails with `__filename has already been declared`.** The `electron.vite.config.ts` injects an ESM `__filename`/`__dirname` shim as a banner. If Rollup code-splits into chunks, each chunk gets its own CJS shim from electron-vite, colliding with the banner. The fix: `inlineDynamicImports: true` in the main build output config forces a single-file bundle. This is the correct shape for an Electron main process with one entry point.

**Ticket-flow E2E fails with strict mode violation on `getByText`.** Ticket description text appears in multiple DOM nodes (kanban card, detail panel description, initial thread message). Scope locators to a container: `detailPanel.locator('p').filter({ hasText: desc })` targets only the description paragraph, not the message `<div>`.

**MCP servers fail to connect in dev.** MCP servers are seeded as templates (`enabled: false`) by default. Enable them via the Company Settings panel or directly in the `mcp_servers` table. Verify the MCP binary is on the PATH. Check `[mcp]` prefixed logs in the main process console.

**Meeting-flow E2E fails with strict mode violation.** Meeting agenda text appears in multiple DOM nodes (detail panel `<h3>` header + system message `<p>`). Scope locators to specific tags: `detailPanel.locator('h3').filter({ hasText: agenda })` for the header, `detailPanel.locator('p.italic')` for system messages. The "Minutes" label also collides with "Meeting Minutes" content — use `getByText('Minutes', { exact: true })` and `locator('div.max-h-32')` for the content.

**Meeting interject not appearing in thread.** The meeting detail panel polls every 2s via `useMeetingDetail` refetchInterval. If an interjection doesn't appear, check that the `meetings.interject` IPC handler is registered and that the meeting status is still `'active'`. Ended meetings reject interjections with an error.

**Runtime strategy shows "Unknown" in Settings.** The hardware profiler runs `wmic` commands on Windows via `execFileSync`. If `wmic` is not on PATH (rare on Windows 11), GPU detection fails silently and defaults to conservative values. The strategy picker still works — it just assumes no GPU.

**Telemetry charts show no data.** Telemetry reads from the `runs` table. If no agent runs have completed, all charts render zeros. Trigger a chat or ticket assignment to populate the runs table, then refresh the Telemetry tab.

**`pnpm dist` fails with native module errors.** electron-builder needs native modules rebuilt for the target Electron ABI. Run `pnpm -F @team-x/desktop exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3,keytar` first. If packaging for a different platform (cross-compilation), native modules must be built on the target OS — use the GitHub Actions release workflow instead.

**Updater shows "not available" in dev.** By design. The UpdaterService returns a no-op in dev and test mode (invariant #7: zero phone-home). The real updater only activates in packaged production builds where `app.isPackaged` is true.

**Agentic loop terminates immediately with `budget_exhausted` or `timeout`.** The three clamps live in `settings` (`agentic_max_steps` default 8, `agentic_max_tokens` default 8000, `agentic_timeout_ms` default 120000). Small local models frequently burn the step budget on malformed tool-call parsing — the M31 T1 parser grants one nudge-retry per malformed step and then counts the step. Bump `agentic_max_steps` to 12 or 16 for 7–8B local models, or switch to a larger model / cloud provider via Settings → Providers. If the loop is exhausting `agentic_max_tokens` before producing an answer, the `query_*` tools are returning too-wide projections — confirm no single tool call exceeds the 50-row cap (the envelope is `{rows, truncated}`; `truncated: true` is a signal to narrow the query).

**Agentic loop step cards only show the final answer in the palette, not intermediate steps.** RESOLVED in M32 T0 (commit `f515ea7`). `useAgentStepStream` now backfills via `command.getRunSnapshot` on mount before attaching the bus listener, with `(runId, stepIndex)` dedup against late-arriving bus events. If you still see only the answer card, confirm `out/main` is up to date (rebuild after a pnpm install / git pull) and that the renderer's `command.getRunSnapshot` IPC roundtrip is firing — check the `[ipc] command.getRunSnapshot` log line in the main-process console.

**System-agent thread doesn't appear in Copilot Conversations right after a complex_request.** RESOLVED in M32 T1 (commit `62a0504`). `useThreadList` now subscribes to `agentic.completed` and `agentic.failed` and invalidates `['threads', companyId]` on either event. If the thread list still shows stale data, confirm the bus listener is wired (the dashboard bus is a singleton — a stale React Strict Mode double-mount can lose the subscription); a hard reload (`Ctrl+R` in dev, restart the app in prod) rewires it.

**Agentic loop fires during a meeting and the user sees stale progress.** By design, not a bug — `AgenticLoopService.start()` observes `orchestrator.isCompanyPaused(companyId)` via a polling wrapper around `providerRouter.complete` (poll interval 250ms prod, 2ms test). The loop queues until the meeting ends, then resumes. The palette stays responsive; the step log shows a single plan card and then idles. Nothing is dropped.

**System-agent or system-copilot missing from a company after restore from backup.** RESOLVED in M33 F4 (2026-04-18). `backup.restore` now calls `backupService.ensurePostRestoreSystemEmployees({ ... })` after the DB + vault files land, and that sweep idempotently re-runs `ensureSystemAgent` + `ensureSystemCopilot` against every company in the restored DB. Both are no-ops for current-schema backups; pre-M31 backups get their `system-agent` rows back; pre-M33 (but post-M31) backups get their `system-copilot` rows back. Per-company failures are recorded in `BackupRestoreResponse.postRestoreSystemEmployees.skipped[]` without aborting the restore. A catastrophic throw from the sweep itself is caught inside the handler and logged — the restore returns manifest-only rather than failing outright, because the DB + vault are already swapped and a hard failure would leave users with an unusable app. If you still see a missing system row after a restore, (a) check the Audit tab for a `copilot.analyzed` cycle that runs cleanly (confirms `system-copilot` exists), (b) open the main-process console and look for `[backup] ensurePostRestoreSystemEmployees` warnings, (c) re-run the restore — the sweep is idempotent.

**Companies repo lacks the `create` / `update` / `delete` IPC channels today even though the CLAUDE.md IPC table lists them.** The table is aspirational for the milestone that introduces multi-company CRUD (not yet scheduled in Phase 5). What EXISTS today: `companies.list` (Phase 1) and `companies.archive` (M33 F3). `companies.archive` is the soft-delete path — it quiesces the copilot analyzer + event window, flips `status` to `'archived'`, and emits `company.archived` on the bus. Hire / fire / promote employees, file tickets, assign projects, and every other mutation channel continues to run against the single Phase 1 company. When the multi-company CRUD milestone lands, `companies.create` MUST call `ensureSystemAgent` + `ensureSystemCopilot` (same contract as `seedIfEmpty` and F4's post-restore sweep) so the newly-created company boots with both system seats populated.

**`agentic-loop.spec.ts` hangs with "timed out waiting for `data-step-kind='answer'`".** The canned provider seam (`test-agentic-provider.ts`) is a three-tier lookup: the `__ECHO_AGENT__:[…]` JSON sentinel first, then the canned per-prompt table, then a generic fallback. If the spec was recently extended with a new prompt that doesn't match any key in `test-agentic-provider.ts` or `test-agentic-tools.ts`, the fallback path runs and can take minutes. Add the prompt key to both seams in lockstep — the rule is any new agentic surface must ship a matching test-side swap (T8 pattern).

**Task Planner: amber confirmation gate never appeared even though my prompt looks write-shaped.** The `WRITE_SIDE_KEYWORDS` regex in `command-service.ts` only catches the locked verbs (*decompose* / *delegate* / *create tickets* / *assign owners* / *review*). Synonyms like "break down", "hand off", "file tickets" don't match — the prompt routes to the M31 read-side loop and runs without a gate. Either rephrase with one of the locked verbs or widen the regex (and update the M32 T5 unit tests in lockstep). The destructive structured intents (`fire`, `close`, `end-meeting`, `promote`) still get the **red** gate independently.

**Task Planner: `delegate_subtask` keeps assigning everything to the same employee.** Workload scoring weights (0.4 role-fit, 0.3 inverse-load, 0.2 availability, 0.1 past-perf) are locked in `agentic-tools-write.ts` and verified in 25 unit tests. In small orgs an employee whose title matches the subtask type AND who is not in a meeting will dominate. Quick fix: archive or set-in-meeting the over-assigned employee so `availability(employee)` returns 0 and the next-highest-scoring employee wins. Long fix: add `capabilities` frontmatter to role.md (deferred to M33/M34) so role-fit becomes more granular than the current title-keyword heuristic.

**Task Planner: subtask escalated and the org chart shows a new ticket on the manager.** Three failed `delegate_subtask` attempts (or three consecutive `review_deliverable` rejects) trigger `task.escalated`. The escalation lifts the subtask one level up the org chart — the manager's `delegate_subtask` queue gets the work next. Filter the Audit tab on `task.escalated` to see the reason payload (`fallback_chain_exhausted` / `repeated_rejects`) and the original subtask. Threshold lives in `planner_escalation_threshold` (default 3, range 1–10) — bump it in Settings → Runtime → Task Planner if escalations fire too aggressively.

**Task Planner: `decompose_project` proposed only 3 subtasks even though I asked for 10.** The `planner_max_tickets` setting is a *cap*, not a target. The LLM proposes whatever count it judges appropriate; the cap only kicks in if it exceeds the limit. Give the prompt more concrete scope ("decompose into 8–10 leaf subtasks", "produce a depth-3 plan with subtasks of subtasks") rather than just bumping the cap. The truncation flag in the envelope (`truncated: true`) tells you when the cap actually fired.

**Task Planner: kanban doesn't update after `delegate_subtask` lands a ticket.** The `task.delegated` event must fire on the bus inside the same transaction boundary that writes the ticket row — that's how `use-ticket-list.ts` invalidates its React Query cache. If the kanban is stale and the Audit tab DOES show the `task.delegated` row, it's a renderer-cache bug (file it). If the Audit tab is missing the row, it's a tool-implementation bug (the write happened but the bus emit didn't — also file it). Workaround: switch tabs and back to force a refetch.

**Task Planner: spec passes locally but CI fails on the amber-gate assertion.** The amber `gateKind: 'write-side'` field is part of the `needs_confirmation` response shape and is checked explicitly in `task-planner.spec.ts`. If a spec edit accidentally swapped to a destructive intent (or the classifier was mis-canned), the palette still renders a confirmation card but with `gateKind: 'destructive'` and the **red** color — the spec's "destructive gate ABSENT" assertion catches this. Trace by checking the canned classifier entry for the test prompt and confirming the intent is `complex_request` not `fire_employee` or similar.

**Unit tests fail with `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch right after running `electron-rebuild`.** Vitest runs against the system Node ABI; `pnpm -F @team-x/desktop exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3,keytar` compiles `better-sqlite3` for Electron's ABI (currently 125). The two are different — vitest then fails 23+ tests with `NODE_MODULE_VERSION` mismatch. `pnpm rebuild better-sqlite3` silently no-op's because pnpm's content-addressed store already has the hashed (Electron-ABI) artifact and reuses it. The reliable fix is to invoke node-gyp directly inside the package's pnpm cache directory:

```bash
# Rebuild better-sqlite3 for system Node ABI before running vitest
cd node_modules/.pnpm/better-sqlite3@11.10.0/node_modules/better-sqlite3 && npm run install
# Then re-run vitest
pnpm test
# Before the next E2E run, rebuild for Electron ABI again
pnpm -F @team-x/desktop exec electron-rebuild -f -w better-sqlite3,keytar
```

The pattern across M31 + M32 + M33 verification gates: **Node rebuild → vitest → Electron rebuild → Playwright**. Repeat as needed when alternating between the two test suites. Same recipe applies to `keytar` if the keychain tests start failing — substitute the keytar path. Verified at M31 T10, M32 T10, and re-verified at M33 T9 + T10.

**Copilot Service: analyzer never produces insights even though `copilot.configure` returned `insightsGenerated: 1` once.** `copilot.configure` is a test-only manual-tick IPC gated on `isTestMode()`. In production, the periodic timer is the only path that produces insights. Confirm `copilot_enabled = true` in **Settings → Runtime → Copilot**, confirm `copilot_categories` is non-empty (empty subset falls back to the full set), and check the Audit tab for `copilot.analyzed { reason: 'periodic' }` rows. If you see `reason: 'malformed_output'`, the LLM is returning drafts that don't match the zod schema — switch to a larger model or bump `agentic_max_tokens` so the model has room to produce well-formed JSON.

**Copilot Service: insights duplicate every 5 minutes.** Dedup is category-scoped + numeric-drift-guarded + Jaccard bigram > 0.8. Two consecutive ticks with byte-identical drafts merge silently (no `copilot.insight` event re-emit on merge). If you see duplicates, the most likely causes are (a) the LLM is classifying semantically-similar drafts under different categories, so they don't merge — tighten `copilot_categories` to remove the noisy category; (b) the titles include shifting numbers ("3 blocked tickets" vs "4 blocked tickets") — that's the numeric-drift guard firing intentionally; (c) the actor truly is generating different titles each tick — file an issue with the prompt summary, the analyzer's prompt-builder might need tuning.

**Copilot Service: `copilot.ask` shows up on the system-agent thread, not system-copilot.** The actor is resolved per call. `copilot.ask` always threads `system-copilot` through as `employeeId`, so its thread surfaces under the **system-copilot** Copilot Conversations row (Sparkles icon, distinct from the Bot icon for system-agent). If you typed your question into the M30 command palette without context, it routed to `complex_request` → `system-agent`; use `copilot.ask` directly (or click into the system-copilot thread first) to route to the Copilot's seat.

**Copilot Service: `copilot.configure` throws "not implemented" or "test-mode only".** By design. `copilot.configure` is the manual-tick test seam (`isTestMode()` gate). Production code paths use `settings.setCopilot` to update cadence; the analyzer picks up the change via `restart(companyId)` automatically. The error message points at the right setting.

**Copilot Service: rolling event window is empty after restart.** `CopilotEventWindow` warm-starts from `events.list({ companyId, limit: 100 })` on first `snapshot` per company. If you see `copilot.analyzed { insightsProposed: 0 }` repeatedly after restart, the warm-start succeeded but the events table is genuinely empty — perform any user action (create a ticket, open a meeting) and the next tick will have signal. The bus subscription is the canonical fallback path: events emitted after the analyzer started land in the deque regardless of warm-start state.

**Copilot Service: spec hangs at the `tool_call(query_copilot_insights)` assertion.** The canned `test-copilot-provider.ts` is the analyzer's seam. The canned `test-agentic-provider.ts` is the `copilot.ask` (agentic-loop) seam. The `copilot-service.spec.ts` E2E uses the `__ECHO_AGENT__:` sentinel path to script the agentic-loop side, so canned-provider entries for `system-copilot` actor are NOT pre-baked into `test-agentic-provider.ts`. If a future copilot E2E adds a non-sentinel prompt, the agentic provider will hit the fallback FIXTURE and the loop may stall — extend the canned tables in lockstep (T8/T9 pattern from M33).

**Copilot UI: `Cmd+Shift+K` does nothing while another dialog is focused.** The App.tsx keydown handler has a `target?.closest('[role="dialog"]')` guard that swallows the shortcut when focus is inside a Radix dialog (Hire, confirmation gates, etc.) — the same guard the M30 palette uses, extended with a `data-copilot-sidebar-root` bypass so the copilot sheet's own sheet (also `role=dialog`) does NOT block re-toggle. If the shortcut is unresponsive from inside another modal, dismiss the modal first — that's intentional: the palette and copilot must not fight foreground dialogs. Fallback: click the Sparkles toolbar button (`data-copilot-toolbar-toggle`) which is always live.

**Copilot UI: insight card dismisses but immediately re-appears.** The dismiss mutation is optimistic (`onMutate` filters the row out) with `onSettled` invalidation. If the card flickers back, (a) `copilot.dismiss` IPC returned an error — check the main-process console for `[ipc] copilot.dismiss` logs; the reconciliation re-queries and sees the row still active. (b) The `copilot.dismissed` bus event was NOT emitted — architectural invariant #11 violation, file it. Recovery: close and re-open the sidebar to force a full refetch.

**Copilot UI: dashboard widget shows empty state even though the sidebar shows insights.** The widget and the sidebar consume the same `useCopilotInsights(companyId)` query — a single React Query cache entry. They should never disagree unless one is mounted before `companyId` is non-null. If you see divergence, the widget was rendered during the Phase-1 companies bootstrap race — a re-render after the companies list resolves fixes it. A full refresh (`Ctrl+R` in dev, restart in prod) always resolves it.

**Copilot UI: toolbar Sparkles button does not show `aria-pressed` state change.** The button uses `aria-pressed={copilotSidebarOpen}` bound to the Zustand slice. If screen readers (or automated a11y audits) report the state as static, the state is desynced — typically happens if two `<TopBar />` instances mount (double-mount in React Strict Mode dev). The slice is a singleton; only one toolbar should render. Confirm with `document.querySelectorAll('[data-copilot-toolbar-toggle]').length === 1`.

**Copilot UI: `copilot-ui.spec.ts` fails with `getByText('Phase 5')` not visible.** The top-bar badge is the version identifier and must stay in sync with CLAUDE.md. M34 bumped the badge `Phase 4` → `Phase 5`. All E2E specs that previously asserted `Phase 4` (smoke, ticket-flow, meeting-flow, vault-backup) were updated in lockstep. If a spec still fails this assertion, either the renderer build is stale (`pnpm -F @team-x/desktop build` before `test:e2e:run`) or the spec was written against an older badge — update it to match the current CLAUDE.md "Phase N" header.

## Things to NOT do

- **Do not use LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen, or Mastra.** They were considered and rejected; our custom orchestrator is differentiated.
- **Do not add telemetry or phone-home endpoints.** Privacy-first is non-negotiable.
- **Do not add a hosted/cloud-sync feature** without a design-doc amendment.
- **Do not introduce React Server Components or Next.js.** This is Electron; client-only React.
- **Do not use eslint + prettier.** Biome only.
- **Do not hardcode model names** in agent code. Use the registry.
- **Do not create a README.md** until phase 4 unless the user explicitly asks.
- **Do not add emojis** to code or docs unless Rocky asks.
